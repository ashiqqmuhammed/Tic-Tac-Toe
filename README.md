# Tic-Tac-Toe
how to play Tic-Tac-Toe:

Objective: The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to get three of your marks (either “X” or “O”) in a row – either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Game Board: You have a 3x3 grid where you and your opponent take turns placing your marks in the empty spaces.
Turns: Players take turns to place their mark on the board. Typically, “X” starts first, but this can vary depending on the version of the game.
Winning Condition: The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
Play Modes:
1-Player Mode: Play against the computer.
2-Player Mode: Play with a friend on the same computer.
Extra Challenges:
Some versions of Tic-Tac-Toe allow for larger grids (e.g., 5x5) for an extra challenge.
You can also switch to “hard mode” for a tougher game.
